    # Machine Setup
    #   If you break your build into multiple jobs with workflows, you will probably want to do the parts of this that are relevant in each
    # The following `checkout` command checks out your code to your working directory. In 1.0 we did this implicitly. In 2.0 you can choose where in the course of a job your code should be checked out.
    - checkout
    # This is based on your 1.0 configuration file or project settings
    - run:
        working_directory: ~/rocky/python2-trepan
        command:  pyenv install 2.7.13 && pyenv local 2.7.13 && pyenv rehash && easy_install nose && pyenv rehash
