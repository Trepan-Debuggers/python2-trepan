trepan 1.2.8 2022-06-05
=======================

* Squelch traceback on break on unparsable file
* Supporting trepan3k back to Python 2.4

trepan 1.2.5 2021-11-28
=======================

* Revise to use xdis 6.0.3

trepan 1.2.4 2021-03-15
=======================

* One small fix was made to support newly-added set patsub

trepan 1.2.3 2021-01-24
=======================

* Add `set tempdir` and `show tempdir`. In remote debugging this is useful
* eval?: add "and" and "or" by stripping out the final and/or
* deal with no style set
* use PyPI term-background package
* fix bug in decompiling

trepan 1.2.2 2020-10-11
=======================

* Extend patsub's effect to breakpoint Hook the command processor file
  pattern substutition to python filecache's file pattern substitution
* Tolerate inspect.formatargvalues() errors
* Go over "set" subcommand processing
* Set min/max args for set patsub
* set style command error message

trepan 1.2.1 2020-08-30
=======================

* Add `info locals --list`
* Correct Formatting of 1-arg bytes in asm
* Get "set patsub" to substitute file paths e.g. "^/code" inside docker -> "/Users/rocky/project"

About "set patsub". We need to do the substitution in the debugger, not in
`pyficache` where we just want the presentation of the filename to be
different. The actual location is the name `pyficache` sees and gets
lines from.

trepan 1.2.0 2020-08-23
=======================

disassembly via [`xdis`](https://pypi.org/project/xdis/) now supports "extended" assembly listing which is new. Use that by default.

Commands have been gone over to be DRYer and use a more modern style of imports.
Small bugs have been fixed in conjunction with going over the commands.

New/Changed commands:

* `set asmfmt` will let you select between the different formats and
* `show asmfmt` will show you what format is in effect
* `info lines` shows more information about what lines can be breakpointed (have line number table offsets in code)
* `info offsets` shows you what offsets can be breakpointed (start on a line-number table entry)
* `info line` gives more information, i.e. offset info, for a given line.


trepan 1.1.0 2020-05-23 pyficache
=================================

* Incorporate a major update of pyficache which removes the coverage dependency.
* More Python source has been reformatted and imports revised along current thinking.
* Some errors in termination messages have been fixed.
* `--AST` renamed to `--tree` since that's what it is and `AST` it is not

trepan 0.8.0 2017-10-27
=======================

User incompatibilty alert!

We have redone location, breakpoint, and list-range parsing.

This release needs an explanation.

Code to parse commands like `list` and `breakpoint` were ugly and hard
to maintain. I hit a the tipping point in adding flexibility to the
"disassemble" command which allows address in addition to the usual
other kinds of locations.

Since version 0.6.3 when the `deparse` command was added, there has
been a hidden dependency of the the Earley parser.

That is now used to simplify parsing concepts like location,
list range, or breakpoint position.

In the process, I've gone over the syntax to make things more gdb
compatible. But of course gdb is also a moving target, so its syntax
has been extended and gotten more complicated as well.

In the olden days, I was sad that debuggers didn't follow someone
else's syntax but instead invented their own, sometimes incompatible
with gdb. Nowadays though it is a Herculean feat to come close to
matching gdb's syntax. Sigh.

The other problem with matching *gdb*'s syntax is that debugging Python
is enherently different from debugging a compiled language with object
files. Python's language model just isn't the same as C's.

So there are deviations. The biggest change that I suspect will impact
users is that function names in locations in this debugger needs a
trailing "()" to mark it as a function. This was not needed in
previous versions and it isn't needed in *gdb*.

Not implimented in our notion of location are things that feel
compiled-language object-file-ish. Specifying the function name inside
an object file, isn't the way Python (or most dynamic languages)
do things.  Instead you list the method/function inside a class or
module. And we allow this to be done off of variables and variables
holding instance methods.

Some things like ending at an address is not implemented as going
backwards in variable-length bytecode is a bit of work. Other things
of dubious merit I've omitted. The flexibility that is there
is probably overkill.

Speaking of reduced flexibility. Now with parser in place we no longer
support expressions as numbers in list commands. It's not in *gdb* and
I have a feeling  that too is overkill.
