This is a rewrite of the Python debugger, [pydb](http://bashdb.sf.net/pydb), itself a derivative of the stock Python debugger *pdb*.

See this [wiki](https://code.google.com/p/pydbgr/w/list) for
more information.

This code makes assumes Python in the version range of 2.5 up to and
not including 3K. Use *pydb* for Python 2.5 and earlier.
